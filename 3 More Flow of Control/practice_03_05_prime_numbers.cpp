REQUIREMENTS:
5. Write a program that finds and prints all of the prime numbers between 3
and 100. 

A prime number is a number such that 1 and itself are the only
numbers that evenly divide it (for example, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, â€¦).

One way to solve this problem is to use a doubly nested loop. The
outer loop can iterate from 3 to 100 while the inner loop checks to
see if the counter value for the outer loop is prime. 

boolean is_prime = false; 
for (int i = 3; i <= 100 ;i++)  // iterate from 3 to 100
{
    for ( int j = 2; j < i-1 ;j++)
    {
        if( i%j == 0) 
        {
            is_prime = false
        }
        else 
        {
            is_prime = true;
        }
        if (is_prime)
        {
            cout << i << " is a prime number" << endl;
        }
    } // end inner for
}// end outer for

One way to see if number n is prime is to loop from 2 to n 21 and if any of these
numbers evenly divides n, then n cannot be prime. If none of the
values from 2 to n 21 evenly divides n, then n must be prime. (Note
that there are several easy ways to make this algorithm more efficient.)
