REQUIREMENTS:
6. The Fibonacci numbers Fn are defined as follows. F0 is 1, F1 is 1, and
Fi+2 = Fi + Fi+1 i = 0, 1, 2, â€¦ . In other words, each number is the sum of the previous
two numbers. The first few Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. 

One place that these numbers occur is as certain population growth
rates. If a population has no deaths, then the series shows the size of the
population after each time period. 

It takes an organism two time periods to mature to reproducing age, and 
then the organism reproduces once  every time period. 

The formula applies most straightforwardly to asexual
reproduction at a rate of one offspring per time period.

Assume that the green crud population grows at this rate and 
has a time period of 5 days. Hence, if a green crud population starts out as 10 pounds
of crud, then in 5 days there is still 10 pounds of crud; in 10 days there
is 20 pounds of crud, in 15 days 30 pounds, in 20 days 50 pounds, and
so forth. Write a program that takes both the 

initial size of a green crud population (in pounds) and a number of days as input, and that outputs

the number of pounds of green crud after that many days. 

Assume that the population size is the same for 4 days and then increases every fifth day. 

Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as desired.
