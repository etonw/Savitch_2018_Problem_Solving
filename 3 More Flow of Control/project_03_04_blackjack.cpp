REQUIREMENTS:
4. Write a program that scores a blackjack hand. In blackjack, a player
receives from two to five cards. The cards 2 through 10 are scored as 2
through 10 points each. 

The face cards—jack, queen, and king—are scored as 10 points.

The goal is to come as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over 21. 

Hence, any score over 21 is called “busted.” The ace
can count as either 1 or 11, whichever is better for the user. For example,
an ace and a 10 can be scored as either 11 or 21. Since 21 is a better score,
this hand is scored as 21. An ace and two 8s can be scored as either 17 or
27. Since 27 is a “busted” score, this hand is scored as 17.

The user is asked how many cards she or he has, and the user responds
with one of the integers 2, 3, 4, or 5. The user is then asked for the card
values. Card values are 2 through 10, jack, queen, king, and ace.

A good way to handle input is to use the type char so that the card input 2, for
example, is read as the character '2', rather than as the number 2. Input
the values 2 through 9 as the characters '2' through '9'. Input the values
10, jack, queen, king, and ace as the characters 't', 'j', 'q', 'k', and
'a'. (Of course, the user does not type in the single quotes.) Be sure to
allow upper- as well as lowercase letters as input.

After reading in the values, the program should convert them from character
values to numeric card scores, taking special care for aces. 

The output is
either a number between 2 and 21 (inclusive) or the word Busted.

You are likely to have one or more long multiway branches that use a switch
statement or nested if-else statement. Your program should include a loop
that lets the user repeat this calculation until the user says she or he is done.
